# DISCOS Project Plan

## Project Overview

DISCOS (DISrete COllinear Skeletonization) is a Python package for 3D mesh manipulation and skeletonization of complex neuronal morphologies. The project has evolved to focus on discrete collinear skeletonization algorithms that can handle complex neuronal shapes without requiring traditional tree-based representations. DISCOS provides tools for processing neuronal meshes, performing systematic segmentation, building connectivity graphs, and converting results to SWC format for simulation software.

## Goals

- Provide robust 3D mesh processing and analysis for neuronal morphologies
- Implement advanced skeletonization algorithms for complex geometries
- Enable systematic mesh segmentation and connectivity analysis
- Support conversion to standard formats (SWC) for simulation workflows
- Maintain interactive visualization and analysis capabilities

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Modules

- **MeshManager** (`mesh.py`): Unified mesh handling, loading, processing, and analysis
- **MeshSegmenter** (`segmentation.py`): Systematic mesh segmentation using cross-sectional cuts
- **SegmentGraph** (`segmentation.py`): Graph representation of segmented meshes with NetworkX
- **SWC Export** (`segmentation.py`): Conversion to SWC format with cycle-breaking support
- **Demo Functions** (`demos.py`): Pre-built test geometries and workflows
- **Core Infrastructure**: Package structure, imports, and utilities
