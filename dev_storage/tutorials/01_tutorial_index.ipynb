    "# GenCoMo Demo Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the GenCoMo (Generalized Compartmental Modeling) demo series! This collection of notebooks demonstrates mesh-based compartmental modeling for neuronal simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The demos are organized into two main sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìê **Part 1: Mesh Creation and Visualization**\n",
    "Learn how to create and visualize different mesh geometries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[01a - Cylinder Mesh Demo](01a_cylinder_mesh.ipynb)** \n",
    "  Basic cylindrical structures and mesh analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[01b - Torus Mesh Demo](01b_torus_mesh.ipynb)**\n",
    "  Ring-shaped (donut) geometries with genus = 1 topology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[01c - Neuron Mesh Demo](01c_neuron_mesh.ipynb)**\n",
    "  Realistic neuron models with soma, dendrites, and branching\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî™ **Part 2: Mesh Segmentation and Connectivity**\n",
    "Learn how to segment meshes into compartments for simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[02a - Cylinder Segmentation Demo](02a_cylinder_segmentation.ipynb)**\n",
    "  Basic z-axis slicing and linear connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[02b - Torus Segmentation Demo](02b_torus_segmentation.ipynb)**\n",
    "  Complex topology handling with multiple segments per slice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[02c - Neuron Segmentation Demo](02c_neuron_segmentation.ipynb)**\n",
    "  Realistic branching structures and topological analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mesh-based Modeling**: Unlike traditional SWC cylinder models, GenCoMo uses realistic 3D mesh geometries for more accurate compartmental modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-axis Segmentation**: Meshes are sliced along the z-axis into fixed-width volumes, with connected components within each slice forming individual segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connectivity Analysis**: Segments that share boundaries in 3D space are connected, forming a graph structure for simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with Part 1** to understand mesh creation and visualization\n",
    "2. **Move to Part 2** to learn segmentation algorithms\n",
    "3. **Follow the progression** from simple (cylinder) to complex (neuron) geometries\n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently, but following the order provides the best learning experience.\n",
    "\n",
