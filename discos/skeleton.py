"""
Skeletonization of a 3D mesh.

The main objective of skeletonization is to represent a 3D mesh in a compact form that
captures its essential shape and connectivity. The DISCOS algorithm achieves this by
slicing up the original mesh along the z-axis into a series of slices. Within each slice,
 the algorithm identifies contiguous segments and creates a graph with edges as segments and nodes as junctions or terminal points.
 The graph is thus an idealized skeleton of the original mesh.

Important terminology:
- "Original Mesh": A mesh is a 3D object defined by a set of vertices, edges, and faces. DISCOS does not destroy the mesh you give it.
    For use in DISCOS, the original mesh should be a single watertight volume with no self-intersections.
- "Bounding planes": The two planes of constant z-value that bound the original mesh: one at the minimum z-value
    and one at the maximum z-value.
- "Terminal points": The points where the bounding planes intersect the original mesh.
    In other words, they represent the minimum and maximum z-value of the original mesh.
- "Cut": A plane of constant z-value that intersects the original mesh. A single cut always has at least one cross-section
    associated with it.
- "Slice": A 3D partition of the original mesh with its volume either between two adjacent cuts,
    or between one cut and one bounding plane.
    A single slice might contain multiple segments (closed volumes). We use the method MeshManager.slice_mesh_by_z to create the slices.
- "Segment": A contiguous 3D sub-volume of the original mesh with its volume between two cuts or between one cut and one bounding plane.
    Every slice necessarily contains at least one segment.
    Each segment has a single contiguous external surface and at least one contiguous internal surface.
- "Cross-section": A contiguous 2D curve (and its area) where the original mesh intersects with a cut.
    It has a surface area (internal to the original mesh volume) in the xy-plane.
    Every cross-section is shared by two adjacent segments. Every cross-section has at least one Junction fitted to it, but perhaps more.
- "Junction": A disk with radius and center position fitted each closed area within the cross-section.
    Junctions are one-to-one with the nodes of the skeleton graph.
- "SkeletonGraph": A graph representation where segments are edges and nodes are junctions and terminal points.
    Edges only connect nodes on adjacent planes. No two nodes at the same cut (z-value) may be connected by an edge.

Important classes: SkeletonGraph, Junction, Segment, CrossSection, ...

The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Validate input mesh: Check if mesh is watertight, has no self-intersections, and is a single hull.
    If not, raise an error. Mesh can be passed as a trimesh object or as an instance of discos.mesh.MeshManager.

2. Create bounding planes at the minimum and maximum z-value of the mesh.
    Extract terminal points.
    Create cuts at regular intervals along the z-axis using MeshManager.slice_mesh_by_z.
    (Each application of slice_mesh_by_z returns a list containing two meshes: one below the cut and one above the cut.)
    The algorithm takes a parameter n_slices which is how many 3D slices (partitions) should be created;
        equivalently, n_cuts = n_slices - 1.
    The slice_mesh_by_z function is repeated n_cuts times, results in the ordered set of slices.

3. For each cut, extract the cross-section. Note that one cross section may include multiple closed areas.
    Fit a junction (radius and center position) to each closed area in the cross-section.

4. Build the SkeletonGraph. Each junction becomes a node and each edge connects two nodes on adjacent cuts.
    A node is connected to another if and only if there is a series of mesh edges connecting their two junctions (in adjacent cuts only),
    meaning they belong to the same segment at different z-values.

5. Validate volume and surface area conservation.
    The sum of the volumes of the segments should agree with the volume of the original mesh within a tolerance.



EXAMPLE 1:
    Consider a cylinder with radius 1 m and height 4 m, aligned with the z-axis.
    The cylinder is centered at the origin (0, 0, 0) and extends from z = -2 to z = 2.
    We will slice the cylinder with n_slices = 4. Each segment should have the same volume.
    There are 3 cuts, each with one cross-section. Each cross section has one junction.
    The skeleton graph should have 5 nodes and 4 edges.
    One node at each of the 3 junctions and one at each point where the mesh intersects the bounding planes,
        and 4 edges (one between each pair of adjacent planes, corresponding to the 4 slices.

        """Write this skeleton graph to an SWC file.

        SWC format: each row has 7 columns: ``n T x y z R p``
          - ``n``: 1-based sample index
          - ``T``: sample type (default 5, overridable via ``type_index``)
          - ``x,y,z``: coordinates (from node ``center``)
          - ``R``: radius (from node ``radius``)
          - ``p``: parent index (or -1 for root)

        Important: SWC requires a tree (no cycles). If this graph contains
        cycles, we can break them in one of two ways (selectable via
        ``cycle_mode``):
          - ``"remove_edge"`` (default): remove one edge per cycle to obtain a
            spanning forest. Prefer removing an edge touching a branching node
            (degree > 2) to preserve simpler chains. Removed edges are
            annotated in the SWC header.
          - ``"duplicate_junction"``: duplicate a branching node within the
            cycle and rewire one incident cycle edge to the duplicate instead
            of removing it. This preserves all segments as edges in SWC while
            yielding a tree. Duplications are annotated in the SWC header so
            downstream tools can reconnect duplicate pairs if needed.

        Args:
            filepath: Destination SWC file path.
            type_index: Type code to write in column T (default 5). You can
                change this to match your downstream tooling.
            annotate_cycles: If True, write header lines describing the cycle
                breaking operations (removed edges or duplicated junctions).
            cycle_mode: "remove_edge" (default) or "duplicate_junction".
                When "duplicate_junction", a branching node on the cycle is
                duplicated and one of its incident cycle edges is rewired to
                the duplicate.

    Build a `SkeletonGraph` by slicing the mesh along z into `n_slices` bands.

      3) For each cut, compute cross-section polygons and fit junctions
